# Phishing Attack EDR-Investigation Report Cybersecurity

# 🛡️ Phishing Attack & EDR Investigation Report

This project simulates a real-world phishing attack that led to an endpoint compromise, combining email threat analysis with endpoint detection and response (EDR) data to practice hands-on cybersecurity skills.

## ✅ Project Summary

Investigated a simulated phishing attack that led to endpoint compromise; analyzed email headers, identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and used EDR data to track file execution across multiple hosts. Applied containment actions and documented the full incident timeline and response in a professional report.

## 🔍 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Email header analysis for phishing detection
- EDR log analysis across multiple hosts
- IOC identification and threat triage
- Incident response lifecycle documentation (Detection → Containment)
- Timeline creation and report writing with flag

## 🧰 Tools Used
- TryHackMe
- Splunk (or EDR log platform used)
- Markdown for reporting
- GitHub for version control and documentation

## 📁 Screenshots Included
